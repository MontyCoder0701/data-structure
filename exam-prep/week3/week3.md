# Linear DS (Array, Linked List)

## Array

- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
- This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

## Linked List

- A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
- The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
- In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Difference between Array and Linked List

- Array is fixed size, but list is dynamic size
- Array is contiguous, but list is not contiguous
- Array is easy to access, but list is not easy to access
