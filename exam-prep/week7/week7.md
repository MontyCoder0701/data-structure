# Queue Application

## Bank Program

Bank programs can be solved using queue because the order of customers in line is determined by the order that they arrive. The teller serves customers in the order that they arrive. The teller serves a customer by printing the customer's name and balance. The teller serves the next customer when the previous customer is finished. The teller serves customers until there are no more customers in line.
